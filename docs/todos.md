# To-Dos

## Bug Fixes

## Minor Changes

- [ ] Add tests to make sure that `get_all_parts` is used in the correct locations (vs `get_static_parts` and `get_dyn_parts`)
- [ ] Clean up tests
    - Which example tests actually test something unique?
    - All tests should use the [tensor naming conventions](./tensor_naming.md)
    - Delete all unused tests except for cnn and conv2d

## Major Changes

- [ ] Add occupancy-based partitioning
- [ ] Add display specification to specify displaying tensors (which ones) or canvas

## Planning

- [ ] How should we specify multiple levels of occupancy-based partitioning
